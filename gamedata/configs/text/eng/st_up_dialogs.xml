	<text>You never really leave Duty. I'm still a rank and file member. Will be for the rest of my life. Only Death or Dishonourable Discharge makes you no longer a part of Duty. The situation is fucked... there was a large emission about to hit. Once you know the Zone, you get to sense these things.. and we were in a skirmish with some Freedom. It was a bad situation. An emission about to hit, and our only salvation was our sworn enemies. I gave the warning, but a lot of our guys couldn't make it in time. Apparently Freedom decided that they couldn't let people, even Duty, if you can believe it, die in such a way so they risked their life to drag our guys to safety. After that the top brass decided that maybe Freedom weren't so bad after all. There's a temporary ceasefire in the station. The Loners are our buffer. Buffer or not, Freedom and Duty are sworn enemies.. and that's not my scene, you know?</text>

<string id="jup_kostoprav_bio_dialog_1">
	<text>I'm your standard Sawbones, I guess. Came here as a free stalker many years ago. I had studied medicine back in the Big Land, but there were a few incidents and I couldn't go back. Luckily the Zone forgives all, I guess. I was stationed with Freedom for a while. Some poor group of stalkers got caught in an anomaly in the Military Warehouses. One guy was killed instantly, the other was badly bleeding. I had to cauterize the poor bastard's wounds with a flare then drag him a mile to the nearest outpost - A Freedom base. I fixed him up, and was recruited for a short while. Back then they were struggling to hold the Monolith back at the Barrier. Such an old term now... when the Scorcher was turned off, I headed up north. Figured there would be plenty of opportunities for a guy skilled at stitching people back together again. So here I am, in Duty's company. It's not too bad... get my own private room and patients from both sides of the conflict. I don't judge... heh.</text>

	<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>

<string id="jup_gavaets_bio_dialog_1">
	<text>Eh... not much to say. I started like most guys back in the Cordon. You ever been there? Got my first weapon from Sid, and not long after that jumped straight into my first anomaly without any protection. Can you imagine that? It's a miracle I managed to survive. I went about my business, much more careful this time, and made a fair trade as a stalker. Decided to give up that game, though. I heard some crazy bastard managed to turn off the Brain Scorcher, so the way to the north was open. I figured there would be more opportunities up north... the road less travelled, y'know? Got up there, and set up shop near here. Decided to open business for stalkers in the area. Why risk my own ass when there's a bunch of crazy bastards willing to do it for you, right? Don't regret it one bit.</text>
